Hi, ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **EvanG** creator of [06Games](https://github.com/06-Games).  
I did a few projects, mostly in C#.

## My projects
### Games
**Angry Dash:** A 2d game where the player must move through maps strewn with obstacles. It has an editor and allows players to share their levels with the community.  
**L'Ã‰popÃ©e MÃ©diÃ©vale:** A discontinued 3D game. It was my very first coding experience and it helped me learn a lot.

### Apps
**06Games Launcher:**  Windows and Android launcher for my projects. It was interrupted but I'm not closed to the idea of relaunching it (Haha).  
**[Suivi-Scolaire](https://github.com/06-Games/Suivi-Scolaire):** A client for some school life management services. It has many very useful functions that the services lacked.  
**[Geneagrab](https://github.com/06Games/GeneaGrab):** A tool to download the pages of the digitized registers available on the websites of departmental archives (mainly French).

### Websites
**[06Games](https://06games.ddns.net/):** A website for 06Games (nothing more to add ðŸ˜„)  
**[My presentation site](https://github.com/06Games/06games.github.io):** A site that I created to present myself and highlight my projects (a bit like what you are reading now...)  
**Espace Pro G:** *Top secret* (Or maybe not that much)

## My collaborations
**[Vanilla Raytraced](https://github.com/MazeWave/Vanilla-Raytraced) ([MazeWave](https://github.com/MazeWave)):** A great, free and open-source RTX resource pack for the Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
